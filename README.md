# MarkdownSort.pl
A simple script that will read a markdown file, sort the headers recursively, and output the results to the command line, where it can be redirected into a file.

Example use:  
`MarkdownSort.pl README.md >README_sorted.md`

Use at your own risk. There are no sanity checks to make sure the file is markdown.
